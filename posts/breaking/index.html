<h3 id=the-problem>The problem</h3>
<p>Have a look at these sayings and clichés:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The hustle and bustle&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Busy-bees&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Eager-beaver&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The early bird gets the worm&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Leave no stone unturned&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Idle hands are the devils playground&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;To fill the unforgiving minute&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Keep up with the Jones&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Our society is built around non-stop activity, forward movement, and full-throttle energy. Need energy? There&rsquo;s coffee. Hate coffee, we have soda. Need something stronger? What about a high sugar/high caffeine energy drink? Need something that will work longer than that? There&rsquo;s <em>5-hour energy</em> shots. Don&rsquo;t want to drink anything? There&rsquo;s caffeine pills.</p>
<p>No wonder there&rsquo;s so much alcohol abuse, sleep disorders, and narcotic abuse in society. We need something to take the edge off of all the caffeine and energy products we&rsquo;re consuming! We need something to take us down.</p>
<p>Like most problems, what is in front of our faces is not the root of the problem itself. It&rsquo;s just an effect of the real problem. For the purposes of this post we&rsquo;re going to look at the pressures we place on ourselves, that feed our self-driven need to be self-driven. Our need to be the &ldquo;best&rdquo;, to be &ldquo;on top&rdquo;, or simply just to &ldquo;keep up&rdquo;, and some of the non-toxic methods we can use to de-stress and refocus, giving us some much needed perspective.</p>
<h3 id=whats-the-sciency-word-about-our-stress1>What&rsquo;s the sciency word about our stress[^1]?</h3>
<p>According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), as many as 40% of U.S. employees report their jobs as being &ldquo;very or extremely&rdquo; stressful[^1]. When is the last time you took a vacation day that wasn&rsquo;t a well-known holiday (or actually a sick day)? I know, it can be difficult. Life can be difficult with partners, kids, and who knows what else (sometimes everything else right?). The last thing we feel like we have time for is a break.<br>
Even if we do we end up thinking to ourselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>What am I missing out on?</li>
<li>What &ldquo;should&rdquo; I be doing instead?</li>
<li>Am I letting down others that depend on me?</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m wasting time</li>
<li>Everyone else thinks I&rsquo;m wasting time</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m failing&mldr;someone or something</li>
</ul>
<p>Humans are very flexible creatures psychologically speaking. We can bend and bend, yet with all of this bending, we need time away from this &ldquo;need&rdquo; for bending to regain our composure. The more we stay within an environment of our stressors we are continuing to bend, but without stepping away (be it for long periods, or even very short ones), we prevent ourselves from regaining our original &ldquo;shape&rdquo;, which in this case is our healthy mental wellbeing.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all different individuals and as such have different needs for recovery when it comes to break periods. Some people may need one single lunch break in the day, while others may need smaller &ldquo;micro-breaks&rdquo; throughout the day, or a combination thereof (this is what I do). Every person is different in their needs here.</p>
<h3 id=the-covid-effect-on-wellbeing>The COVID effect on wellbeing</h3>
<p>Everyone has different views on COVID-19, but one common effect it had in most places across the globe was forcing people to work-from-home. In this new type of work environment, people who were used to taking their break in the form of going home at night, found that they were instead working at night&mldr;.at home. After some time they found that it was not as easy to maintain the same composure they once had. There are great things about working from home, but bringing work to your home, means that you must purposefully take time for breaks.</p>
<h3 id=how-i-break>How I break</h3>
<p>There are about 4 things I do to take breaks throughout my day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meditation</li>
<li>Make tea</li>
<li>Take my dog (Storm) for a walk</li>
<li>Exercise during my lunch break</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t typically meditate during the workday but I do when I first wake up in the morning. Even if it&rsquo;s not a traditional meditation, just some time to sit, awake and listen in silence is good for clearing the mind, and entering the day without any preconceptions, or &ldquo;leftovers&rdquo; from the previous day.</p>
<p>For me making a good cup of tea is a process that allows me to step away for a few minutes and think about nothing in particular. It&rsquo;s a very short break, but one that is essential for de-coupling my mind from work.</p>
<p>Our dog (Storm) reminds us that he would like to go out on a walk at various times in the day. We can&rsquo;t always oblige but do try to walk him at least once a day. This provides a good 20-30 minute break and the benefit of some time walking outdoors, which is light exercise and great for the mind and body.</p>
<p>Lastly, I found that when you work from home you can pretty much have lunch whenever you want. I like to break my workday into &ldquo;before workout&rdquo; and &ldquo;after workout&rdquo;. This lets me put a &ldquo;break&rdquo; in the day itself of at least an hour. It&rsquo;s perfect for clearing my mind, pushing my body, and provides a short reset.</p>
<h3 id=you-do-you-boo>You do you Boo</h3>
<p>Some of the things I&rsquo;ve mentioned as breaks may not appeal to you. The breaks I use don&rsquo;t have anything to do with my work, and they are things I enjoy. That&rsquo;s the point though, to get out of your head. Pick something you do enjoy, and do that when you feel like you&rsquo;ve bent a little too far, or (more importantly), do it <strong>BEFORE</strong> you feel like you&rsquo;ve bent too far.</p>
<h3 id=final-thoughts>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>Regardless of the job you have, the health and wellness of your mind (and your overall psychology) depend on your ability to break. Whether it is at work, after work, or on some type of vacation. We can&rsquo;t always be &ldquo;On&rdquo;. When we are, we are the perfect example of entropy, degrading over time. Therefore, take care of your mental wellbeing by taking breaks. Work with your employer to take them at the times you need them.</p>
<p>Productivity demands employers take care of the working conditions of their employees. Some of the ways these conditions may be improved upon is by understanding the needs of their employees in this area. One of the unexpected benefits of the pandemic I believe, has been that this conversation has been happening on a more regular basis.</p>
<p>It is now up to us as individuals to replace blind vanity and ambition with more healthy work ethic choices that will protect our minds for many more years to come.</p>
