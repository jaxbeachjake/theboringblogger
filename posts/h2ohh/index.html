<p>Water comprises the majority of our bodyweight (both as infants and adults), and we consume it in a variety of ways (soft, hard, spring, well, carbonated and distilled), and not just directly but indirectly from food, and (to a lesser extent), from oxidation of macronutrients (metabolic water)[^1].</p>
<p>Despite this, it is estimated that around 75% of Americans are chronically dehydrated[^2]. Body water can be lost through the skin, lungs, kidneys, and GI tract, the loss of which without sodium causes dehydration[^2].</p>
<p>Although there are different types and causes of dehydration, most of us are aware that the ultimate result of dehydration is death. Our bodies cannot exist with a total water deficit. We need water to survive.</p>
<h3 id=just-under-the-surface>Just under the surface</h3>
<p>What most do not understand about dehydration however is that between the extreme of over-hydration, and being so dehydrated that you may be close to death, there are very subtle problems of dehydration including; unclear thinking, mood changes, body temp overheating, constipation, and kidney stones[^3].</p>
<p>On the other side, the positives of effective hydration in our bodies are maintaining a normal body temperature, lubricating and cushioning joints, protecting sensitive tissues, and getting rid of wastes through precipitation, urination, and bowel movements[^3].</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a parent you know that hydration of your child is of the utmost importance, especially when they are running a temperature, vomiting, or have diarrhea. The same applies to us of course, but we do not always take care of ourselves the way we should.</p>
<h3 id=so-how-much-water-should-we-be-drinking-each-day>So how much water should we be drinking each day?</h3>
<p>8 glasses is the &ldquo;official&rdquo; recommendation right? Well like everything else, there really isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; rule here. But 8 glasses was recommended to get close to that. The following article by the <a href=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256>Mayo Clinic</a> recommends 3.7 liters of water for men (2.7 liters for women) per day.</p>
<p>This can seem like a lot, but like I mentioned, what you need can be determined by several factors including your lifestyle. For instance, if you live in a warmer climate that makes you perspire more, you will need to replace that fluid to prevent dehydration. So you will need to drink more.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you exercise daily, you will need to drink more water to replace any fluids you lose due to those actions.</p>
<h3 id=dude-its-impossible-to-drink-that-much-water-in-one-day>Dude, it&rsquo;s impossible to drink that much water in one day</h3>
<p>First of all, you don&rsquo;t want to <em>over</em> hydrate. You <strong>can</strong> drink too much water. So, just like with all things, there needs to be a healthy balance here. Given that, if you&rsquo;re a normal person consuming a glass of water here and there, it is most-likely possible to increase your daily water consumption.</p>

<p>Disclaimer:<br>
As with any other type of advice that deals with health and wellness your mileage may vary. I am not a medical professional and would recommend you consult one before changing your dietary habits concerning anything I&rsquo;m mentioning here. We are all different and sometimes our bodies tolerate things differently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a while now, I&rsquo;ve consumed what I would consider to be at least 3.7 liters of water a day (usually about a gallon though). I usually try to stay under a gallon because when I consume that much daily on a regular basis I don&rsquo;t see any other positive effects (and pee that much more 24x7). Staying just under a gallon however is my &ldquo;sweet spot&rdquo;. I exercise most days however, and do live in a more tropical climate most of the year, so that needs to be taken into account.</p>
<h3 id=its-all-about-quality>It&rsquo;s all about quality</h3>
<p>The first thing that makes drinking more water easier is if you&rsquo;re drinking high quality water. You may be blessed to live in a location where your tap water is of good quality. Otherwise I would recommend a pitcher with a water filter similar to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brita-Small-Filter-Pitcher-Standard/dp/B015SY3W7K/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=10OZ2PUNN5C3C&keywords=brita+water+pitcher&qid=1644530641&sprefix=brita+%2Caps%2C105&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyMDZSVEhUMUFSMERHJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDc4MzU4MlM1SlY3QjM2UDdHViZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUExMDQ2NTAwUlo3QzZFMFA5MzNZJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==">this</a> one from Brita.<br>
My wife, kids, and I were drinking so much water that we ended up investing in a Reverse Osmosis (RO) system. We felt that it was necessary due to the poor water quality we have in the area (having previously put in a water softener).</p>
<p>Next, it makes it easier to drink more water, if you can keep yourself accountable. You can easily do that by actually seeing how much water you are drinking, and how much you have to go. Water bottles like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DEVICO-Frosted-Plastic-Cycling-Running/dp/B088BZPS35/ref=sr_1_4_sspa?crid=1K7R2NLAX9XE7&keywords=water%2Bbottle&qid=1644530818&sprefix=water%2Bbottl%2Caps%2C133&sr=8-4-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzU1RBSk5KVllZNDdHJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMTU1MzgwMU5QNjlINDlYSFU5WCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMDg2NzYxMTBCMVkwQUVUVVo5RCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU&th=1">this one</a> can be used in this manner. Keep in mind, what I am listing are just examples and I am not endorsing any specific products here.</p>
<h3 id=are-there-any-other-health-benefits-here>Are there any other health benefits here?</h3>
<p>You may not have thought of it, but you wake up dehydrated. Usually, you don&rsquo;t drink anything during the night. The first thing you drink in the morning shouldn&rsquo;t be coffee (or hair of the dog, lol). It should be water. It&rsquo;s good for your brain, and good for your organs. I&rsquo;ve noticed sharper mental clarity from drinking more water, better flexibility, stronger workouts, and yes I think it keeps me more regular too :)</p>
<p>Water is what we are all primarily made up of so it stands to reason we should replenish ourselves often. I believe it can help our immune system as well in a way, by keeping things moving and keeping our organs working at their best.</p>
<p>So raise a glass (or many)&mldr;&mldr;.of water today!</p>
