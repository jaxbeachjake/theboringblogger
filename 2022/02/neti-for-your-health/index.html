<p>Winter&rsquo;s the season for the sniffles. Combine that with the COVID pandemic that has put a strain on the healthcare system, and prevention of common ailments is becoming extremely important for us all. Luckily there is a simple solution to lessen the severity of (and in some cases prevent) these conditions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disclaimer:<br>
I am not a medical professional, and although will be providing links to medical resources and practices, this does not replace professional medical advice. It is recommended to consult a physician prior to attempting any healthcare practice or regimen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My wife first introduced the concept of the <em>Neti pot</em> to me, about 5 or so years ago. She had heard about it from a friend of hers who swore by the practice.<br>
As a daily ritual, using a Neti pot (a.k.a. &ldquo;nasal rinse&rdquo;, or Nasal Irrigation &ldquo;NI&rdquo;), it usually involves a mixture of purified saline water (distilled water with iodine-free, preservative-free salt, and baking soda mixture) that is poured into one nostril allowed to pass through the nasal cavity and out the other nostril.</p>
<p>When my wife told me about this practice, my first thought that this was barbaric? Medieval? Nuts? It sounded like something that was an &ldquo;old wives tale&rdquo;, but she explained that the result were similar to swimming at the beach. Ocean water has a high salt content which (when you swim in it) flushes your nasal cavities and you end up with that feeling of being &ldquo;cleaned out&rdquo;. Ok, I get that but it&rsquo;s not normally an enjoyable experience so why subject yourself to that on the daily right? So she started her regimen and I abstained.</p>
<p>For us, the results spoke for themselves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a person that gets colds or the flu often. When I get sick I get sick, and yeah I get &ldquo;a&rdquo; cold now and then, but usually I&rsquo;m a pretty healthy guy. My wife&rsquo;s the one with a more constant allergy issues. So this is the part where I say that the Neti resolved all of my wife&rsquo;s allergy issues and solved all the ones I never knew I had right? No, not that type of post.</p>
<p>My wife slowly got me on board because one of the things I did get on a more frequent basis were sinus headaches. Not so much colds but just pressure headaches. These would not always come with what I would call &ldquo;stuffed up&rdquo; sinuses, but the headaches were bad enough for me to give the Neti a go.</p>
<p>Slowly I started to notice an improvement both in the amount and intensity of these headaches. I rarely take any medication for it where I used to take tons of Over The Counter (OTC) meds for the symptoms.</p>
<p>Similarly the Neti did not solve all of my wife&rsquo;s issues but did lessen the intensity of many of them, causing the reliance of these OTC meds to be much less.</p>
<p>I think that one of the best effects of using Nasal Irrigation (NI) on a regular basis, is the possible need for less OTC meds all together. We live in a society that has a pill for everything, and if that pill has side effects, then there&rsquo;s a pill for that pill and so on and so fourth. It&rsquo;s a waterfall of products and also happens to be an extremely effective business model, making you pull out your wallet every time you sneeze.</p>
<p>Ok, so you&rsquo;re asking what doctors have to say about this right? I mean if this is something that&rsquo;s been around for awhile I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a well-know procedure for working or not? Right? Well as things go in the medical field, sort-of.</p>
<p>Sometimes doctors do recommend NI for the common cold and other nasal-specific issues. The practice is actually fairly old, adopted by Western Medicine in the 19th century but likely originated from the Ayurvedic Indian medicine tradition. When prescribed it is usually for Acute Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URITs), Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) or Allergic Rhinitis (AR) among possible other conditions.</p>
<p>From studies of NI, knowing issues with the procedure involve the temperature of the water being too cold/hot, contamination of the water/devices used, and willingness to continue treatment. This last one is mainly because pouring saline water in one nostril and out the other isn&rsquo;t the most enjoyable experience (at least until you get more used to it), so studies that involved children were kind of hit-or-miss in this area.</p>
<p>Going back to contamination issues, it is important to use distilled, filtered, or at least boiled (and cooled to room temp) water. Given the varied nature of public water across the globe, it is important to keep the water used in these treatments of the highest quality possible.</p>
<p>Likewise, ensuring the device you are using (whether Neti &ldquo;pot&rdquo;, or a bulb bottle device) is regularly cleaned is important. Experts disagree on whether bacteria makes a hugely negative difference here (as there are bacteria in both the device and your nose on a regular basis), but one thing is certain, cleaning these instruments regularly can&rsquo;t hurt[^1].</p>
<h3 id=so-how-do-i-get-started>So how do I get started?</h3>
<p>WebMD has a decent article on the basics <a href=https://www.webmd.com/allergies/neti-pots>here</a>, that I would recommend before going out and purchasing anything.</p>
<p>Once you review these items here are two of the different types of NI I&rsquo;ve used:</p>
<p>This first one is what I would first recommend. It is not a Neti &ldquo;pot&rdquo; per-se, but has great salt packet refills that are easy to replace, along with a bottle that has an easy-to-use spout, is easy to wash, and is also easy to find at your local pharmacy:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/NeilMed-Sinus-Rinse-Complete-Premixed/dp/B092HVFBB2/ref=sr_1_15?crid=5QA89WYLPLVE&keywords=nasal+rinse&qid=1644166158&sprefix=nasal+ri%2Caps%2C358&sr=8-15">Amazon NeilMed Sinus Rinse</a></p>
<p>Still from NeilMed, but a classic Neti pot design:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/NeilMed-Classic-Porcelain-Premixed-Packets/dp/B08FD1WHS2/ref=sr_1_26?crid=3C06QBGDGWTFF&keywords=neti+pot&qid=1644166297&sprefix=neti+pot%2Caps%2C290&sr=8-26%22">Amazon NeilMed Neti Pot</a></p>
<p>We have even used NI on our 2 boys. Our boys are a little older (one in his teens and the other not far behind). Our youngest has the majority of sinus issues since birth. He has had ear tubes, and both his tonsils and adenoids removed. We even took him off of all dairy products for a while, which did help his overall symptoms up until his 3rd birthday. Whenever they have serious sinus problems they have gotten to a point where they will even ask for the Neti pot (at least the younger one will). As with everything regarding children, patience and caution are recommended. Like I mentioned earlier, it is not always the most enjoyable experience, but the more it is used, the more comfortable you get with it.</p>
<p>Overall my wife and I use NI regularly in our daily routines and have found it to be an effective way to ward off common reoccurring illnesses, and the need to take more and more OTC medications that only seem to mask the issue without ever solving it. The &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; of it can take some getting used to, but after a while I look forward to it, especially during this time of the year when sinus issues seem to be more common, it can help make the season more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Good luck to you!!</p>
