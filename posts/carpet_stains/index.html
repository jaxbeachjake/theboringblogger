<h2 id=a-simple-solution-ive-used-on-almost-any-carpet-stain-for-fast-professional-quality-results>A simple solution I&rsquo;ve used on almost any carpet stain for fast professional quality results!</h2>
<p>So, quite a number of years ago my girlfriend (now wife) and I had an apartment together in a historical district of town. We started with basically nothing. The floors were hardwood and so we purchased some rugs for the living and bedroom areas. My girlfriend had brought her white-fabric couches from her apartment when she moved in. We were young, no kids yet, and generally no cares, and life was good.</p>
<p>As it usually goes, life happens right? Living our lives came with us wanting to take care of the small &ldquo;home&rdquo; we had built for ourselves, which included the unavoidable problem of stains on our rugs and couches.</p>
<h3 id=the-problem>The problem</h3>
<p>When we finally got around to wanting to clean these stains we tried the store-bought spray on stain cleaners, we rented the hardcore units that make you feel like you&rsquo;re cleaning up a murder scene, we even used an old school Kirby vacuum cleaner with a carpet cleaning attachment. They helped to some degree, but none of these items came close to the incredibly simple solution I&rsquo;m about to mention.</p>
<p>Everyone usually has some basic supplies in their homes for cleaning either themselves, cleaning dishes, clothes, basic medical supplies, etc. But what do we do when we have a problem? We go out and buy or Google the niche product that exactly fits the problem we have. Constant exposure to advertisements over the years have created a mindset that there is a &ldquo;product&rdquo; for everything, and that these &ldquo;products&rdquo; are out there and just a &ldquo;click&rdquo; away, when sometimes the real solution is right under our noses.</p>
<h3 id=the-magic-solution>The &ldquo;magic&rdquo; solution</h3>
<p>Most people have dish soap for doing the dishes. I don&rsquo;t know anyone that relies solely on the dishwasher 100% of the time (although it would be nice). Likewise, most people also have Hydrogen Peroxide lying around (my wife and I have two boys so it&rsquo;s on hand for cleaning cuts and various bangs and scrapes).</p>
<p>How we usually use these two is to mix about 3 parts Hydrogen Peroxide with 1 part dish soap (depending on the size of the stain). I&rsquo;ve seen other articles suggest blue Dawn brand dish soap, which we&rsquo;ve used, but we&rsquo;ve also seen results with other dish soap brands.</p>
<p>If the stain is fresh you would want to pat it dry (scrubbing is not recommended).<br>
Mix the Hydrogen Peroxide and dish soap mixture well and pour onto the stained area. Let sit for a period of time (usually an hour at least) and then run fresh water over the area. Again, it&rsquo;s not a good idea to scrub the area if you can keep from it, so firmly pat dry with rags or let sit with weighted rags (changing out with dry ones as needed) to help pull the moisture and stain elements out.</p>
<p>After the area has dried vacuum it completely and take a look at the results. It may need a few more sessions to clear the stain out depending on what it was, what the rug (or other item type) fabric is, and how long it has been there. I would not say this technique is 100% effective, but it is our go to solution and has worked way more than not and saved us tons of $$$ on professional cleanings.</p>
<h3 id=some-important-notes>Some important notes</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that since Hydrogen Peroxide is a bleaching agent you may want to test a small area at first to make sure there are no adverse side effects. For us this has worked to clean out wine, blood, lipstick, poop (kids & pets), vomit (yeah some kids, some not lol), with some of them having set for quite a while before cleaning.</p>
<p>Your mileage will vary with everything, but the more you take care of what you have, the more mileage you will get.</p>
<p>Good luck to you!</p>
