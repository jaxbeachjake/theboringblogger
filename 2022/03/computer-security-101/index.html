</figure><h3 id=all-your-data-are-belong-to-us>All Your Data Are Belong To Us&mldr;&mldr;</h3><p>I&rsquo;ve worked in Information Technology for over 20 years. In the past 4 years or so I&rsquo;ve focused primarily in the security space and can attest that there are a lot of misconceptions regarding security (and security professionals). Despite what most people think, the basics computer security isn&rsquo;t complicated or difficult. It mostly boils down to some common sense actions and decisions that anyone at all skill levels can achieve.</p><p>Although it may be common sense, working with computers and understanding their actions (or consequences) isn&rsquo;t common for most people, and can even be intimidating at times, so I&rsquo;ll break things down in an short easy-to-understand guide.</p><h3 id=section-1-under-the-hood>Section 1: Under The Hood</h3><p>Before diving into some basics of computer security let&rsquo;s talk a little about the software and hardware lifecycle. I know, this already sounds complicated right? I promise it&rsquo;s not, so let&rsquo;s go.</p><p>Most people look at purchasing technology like an investment. The problem with this justified type of purchase is that technology isn&rsquo;t an investment, it&rsquo;s a consumable. It&rsquo;s meant to be used for a period of time and discarded. I know this flies in the face of the home user, and only bolsters corporate greed, but corporations control the lifecycle of the product, which is tied to the security of the product. Think of it like this:</p><p>No updates = No security</p><p>So sure, keep that old PC, iPhone, or Kindle but only as long as you&rsquo;re actively updating it.</p><h3 id=section-2-update-update-update-andupdate>Section 2: Update, Update, Update and&mldr;..Update</h3><p>Did I mention you need to update your devices? It bears repeating. Most newer models of software (whether on your PC, phone, or tablet) will automatically update, but if not, you will need to perform the updates yourself.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t forget devices you depend on that are easy to forget about, like Internet routers, wireless access points, gaming consoles, printers, and wearables.</p><h3 id=section-3-email-is-the-problem-long-live-email>Section 3: Email is the problem. Long live email.</h3><p>Email. It&rsquo;s the digital mailbox that no one asked for, no one wanted to keep, and 30+ years later (even with the myriad security issues), no one can seem to get rid of.
Generally, the problem with email boils down to the following:<br>
Anyone can sign-up for an email account, and anyone can send you an email (given they know your address or can guess it). Shortly after email (and the Internet) took off, marketing gurus figured out that if they supported website code (HTML) in an email body, they could make emails look &ldquo;prettier&rdquo;, more attractive, and do what every marketing person dreams of&mldr;.drive interaction with clicks!</p><p>Unfortunately anything that can be used for good, can many times also be used for ill purposes. This is how spam, phishing and all of the other methods of email subterfuge occur.</p><p>Email security boils down to the following precept:</p><ul>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t recognize it, don&rsquo;t click on it.</li></ul><p>Because emails can be &ldquo;spoofed&rdquo; or faked to look like they really came from another person or location, simply relying on who the email says it is from is not enough.</p><p>It is the same with Internet links in the body of the email. These links can be forged to look like one location, while sending you to another.</p><p>One of the most dangerous items in email security, is the attachment. Specifically attachments containing macros. I&rsquo;m specifically referring to Microsoft Office documents (think Word and Excel documents specifically, although others can definitely be used too). If you&rsquo;ve used these Office applications in the past you may have created a macro to automate portions of a specific task. A macro is just a programmable component of that application, and malicious attackers use macros for downloading and staging viruses, including dangerous Ransomware.</p><p>The main thing to remember when dealing with email attachments that contain macros (especially ones that you do not recognize) is to <strong>not enable macros</strong>. The email will tell you to enable them, but the application will warn you, if you open the attachment, however it&rsquo;s always better not to get to that point by not opening it at all.</p><h3 id=section-4-secure-connections>Section 4: Secure connections</h3><p>Let&rsquo;s talk VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), and ToR (The Onion Router), and public WIFI.<br>
First off, it is dead simple to setup a fake wireless network in a public location, called &ldquo;Starbucks Guest&rdquo;, with no authentication. As soon as you connect you would possibly get prompted to trust a security certificate, and it would be all downhill for you from there.</p><p>Many of us suffer from a condition with technology called &ldquo;alert fatigue&rdquo;. The reaction to this fatigue is that we stop questioning what is &ldquo;correct&rdquo; behavior and what is not, and as a result we press or click-through whatever we need to in order to stop the alerts. The specific problem with trusting an unknown security certificate like this on a public WIFI connection is that it allows the attacker to intercept and view all Internet-based traffic without encryption. This what is called a &ldquo;Man-In-The-Middle&rdquo; attack. This includes traffic you may make to your bank account, or any other sensitive site. So, free public WIFI may be unavoidable some times, but it should be a last resort, and if using it, it&rsquo;s usually recommended to use with &ldquo;protection&rdquo;. In this case, &ldquo;protection&rdquo; being a VPN connection.</p><p>There are many 3rd party VPNs that you can subscribe to. Specifically the iOS app <em>1.1.1.1</em>, or <em>Quad1</em>, or <em>Warp</em> (whatever you want to call it) by CloudFlare is free, and pretty solid for a mobile VPN. For most users, a quick Google search of the &ldquo;Top 10&rdquo; will suffice. The only time you may want to be more scrupulous of the VPN provider is if you are needing to ensure your traffic logs are not being kept by the provider (or that the provider will under no circumstances hand over the logs if subpoenaed). The best recommendation in this case would probably be to learn how to roll your own VPN solution (configure from base), however that is a much more advanced topic.</p><p>The Onion Router (ToR), has the rap of being the on-ramp to the &ldquo;Dark Web&rdquo;. Some people think that ToR = anonymity. This is not true. A VPN can help with anonymity (and is <strong>HIGHLY</strong> recommended before using ToR), but think of ToR like a ride through a slightly sketchy part of town. Sure there may be some decent parks and restaurants, but you need to be smart because there&rsquo;s a chance you are being watched, you can be followed, and there are some shady people out there just looking to take advantage of a new mark.</p><h3 id=section-5-passwords-security-questions-and-managers>Section 5: Passwords, Security questions, and managers</h3><p>We&rsquo;ve all seen the password security meme&rsquo;s at this point (or lived a version of it) right?</p><p><a href=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*D0Ta5Z7_Ovidh-jN_ibbjA.jpeg>Password_Meme</a></p><p>Password requirements have become more and more complex over the years. This is because, with the increase of computer power, and the usual methods of storing sensitive data have given rise to more effective methods for malicious extraction and de-obfuscation.</p><p>Think of it like this; if you live in a neighborhood that is prone to burglaries, you might install a deadbolt along with a heavier door. If the would-be robbers proved to be good at lock-picking, you might install video cameras, and then you might go so far as to install a privacy fence, an internal electronic alarm (with backup battery), a guard dog, flood lights, or possibly even private security services. The point is that you would keep increasing your security measures to keep up with the on-going threat of robbery, in at least equal measure to the value of goods you are trying to protect.</p><p>Similarly, with increasing threats to cracking your passwords and gaining access to your personal (or professional) data, you have up the ante when creating and selecting them.</p><p>A good password doesn&rsquo;t have to be so complicated that you can&rsquo;t remember it. It just needs to be sufficiently long enough to prevent anyone else from being able to crack it by being easy enough to guess it or brute force it using specialized tools and/or password dictionaries.</p><p>A good long password is usually about 16-characters. This sounds long right? But &ldquo;jeep green canteen&rdquo;, is 18-characters (with spaces), and is just a jumble of things around me right now. According to <a href=https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/>How Secure Is My Passowrd</a> this seemingly easy password to remember, would take upwards of 4 hundred billion years to brute force! Hackers like low-hanging fruit. This isn&rsquo;t even within the realm of the universe of possibility with the tools we have right now. So think about passphrases when you need a password that you have to remember, and don&rsquo;t get ruffled when you have to make it a long one! But what about times when you have complexity requirements?</p><p>A password manager can help with this. A password manager is an application that you install on your PC, your smartphone, and that you can also access via a web browser. It keeps your passwords secure, while allowing you to create uniquely different ones for each service that requires a password.<br>
The best part of using a password manager is that you only have to remember one password to &ldquo;unlock&rdquo; the password vault and gain access to all of your other passwords. Suffice it to say that this &ldquo;master password&rdquo; needs to be one that is long and hard to guess, but easy to remember (just like the passphrase we made above). The benefits of using a password manager are that you up your security by being able to use different passwords for services so attacks like password-spraying are not effective, it can help you choose sufficiently secure passwords for those services, and many of them also include breach detections to tell you if the service that password has been used in has had any recent compromises.</p><p>Since many services now force (or highly recommend) the use of multifactor authentication by the means of a One-Time Password (OTP) which is like a PIN code that changes frequently, most password managers can support this by integrating with common OTP services like Google&rsquo;s Authenticator.</p><p>Security questions are a means by which attackers can sometimes cause a reset of your password by answering specific questions about you that you have previously setup. They can oftentimes find out the answers to these questions by perusing your social media feeds, or other publicly available sources of information. Keep in mind that the answers to these questions do not have to be true! You can use off-the-wall answers here or password-based rules to answer these questions and store the unique answers in your password manager for safe keeping! An example of some password manager services include 1Password, LastPass, Dashlane, and Bitwarden, among others.</p><p><strong>A quick note about Excel and physical notebooks.</strong><br>
There is an argument to be made about keeping all of your passwords in an Excel spreadsheet or a physical notebook, many people do it. But there is an availability issue here. What if your computer crashes, or the online storage service where you&rsquo;re keeping your Excel spreadsheet exists, gets corrupted, or compromised? All your passwords (and access to services) would be gone! I once found a vendor&rsquo;s password notebook in an hospital&rsquo;s café&rsquo;! Having the info secured online is definitely a risk, but it is more accessible, and having it secured online with a service that is designed to be secure, is a better alternative to one that is prone to other availability issues.</p><p>Just like some password managers can watch your back by checking if the service you are using has been compromised, you can also sign up your email address to see if it has been flagged for any compromises. Organizations can be sneaky sometimes, there are many 3rd, and sometimes 4th parties that are involved with managing your data that most of us are hardly even aware of. That&rsquo;s not totally true, we are made &ldquo;aware&rdquo; of the possible existence of these transactions through terms of service agreements that we all click through, but the point is that sometimes these other parties also have breaches that leak our data. The service <a href=https://haveibeenpwned.com/>Have I Been Pwned</a> is a trustworthy service you can sign up for to see what (if any) breaches your email address has been linked to.</p><h3 id=misc-security-resources>Misc. Security Resources</h3><p>Security is a never-ending topic unfortunately, there is much more that we could hit, from individual device security, to social media security, and backups, but would not fit into a short article such as this. Luckily many industry experts got together to offer a free service to help consumers with all of these questions and issues. The site is called <a href=https://securityplanner.consumerreports.org/>Security Planner</a> and is now run by Consumer Reports. You can use it to pinpoint your specific security need and receive professional advice based on that need.</p><p>So don&rsquo;t be intimidated by security topics, security is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility that owns and operates these connected devices, and so long as we all treat these devices with respect and a little knowledge we can go a long way in protecting our identities, and our data!</p></div></div><div id=post-footer class="post-footer main-content-wrap">
