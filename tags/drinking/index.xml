Your body probably is. Put the bunny in the box, take the water out. Water comprises the majority of our bodyweight (both as infants and adults), and we consume it in a variety of ways (soft, hard, spring, well, carbonated and distilled), and not just directly but indirectly from food, and (to a lesser extent), from oxidation of macronutrients (metabolic water)[^1].
Despite this, it is estimated that around 75% of Americans are chronically dehydrated[^2].</description></item></channel></rss>
